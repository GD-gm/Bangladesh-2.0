                <h4 class="name">Innovation</h4>
                <p class="details">Innovation has been the dominant catchword in the last few decades. It usually happens with the development of a totally novel idea, or around the alteration of existing ones, and is sometimes enough to disrupt the whole system. However, pursuing innovative ideas is about balancing opportunities against risks. </p>

                <h4 class="name">Sustainability</h4>
                <p class="details">The world is changing rapidly, and so is our relationship with the environment. Climate change is reshaping the very cities we live in. Urban flooding, exacerbated by extreme weather, is among the most devastating consequences, threatening lives, infrastructure, and economies.  </p>

                <h4 class="name">Infrastructure</h4>
                <p class="details">Known as the “Land of Rivers”, Bangladesh owes its distinctive tasselled coastline to the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, journeys require negotiating one or more rivers. Couple the riverine landscape with risks including earthquakes and climate change, and it’s easy to see how infrastructure bottlenecks have long inhibited Bangladesh’s development. </p>

                <p class="details">Women’s empowerment is a core issue of contemporary development. It underscores the notion that women are active agents,  population – national emancipation and development remain a far cry. Evidence shows that the empowerment of women helps to create inclusive, open and prosperous societies. </p>

                Dr Yunus emphasised the interim government's dedication to restoring democracy, combating corruption, and overhauling key sectors such as the judiciary, banking, and education. He called on all political parties to support these efforts, urging a consensus-driven approach to rebuild the nation on a foundation that truly serves the public interest. His vision for a new Bangladesh is one where the sacrifices made during the recent uprising translate into a just and democratic society.
